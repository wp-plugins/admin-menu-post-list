Display a post list in the admin menu

== Description ==

Admin Menu Post List adds a simple post list in the admin menu for easy access. It supports posts, pages, and custom post types.

In the normal admin menu, when you're editing a post and wish to go to another one, you have to click on All Posts, then select a post -- or have All Posts open on another browser tab. With the Admin Menu Post List, you can just select the next post to edit, direct from the menu.

* Install and activate the plugin
* Go to *Settings->Post List* and select post types to enable

A post list will be added to the bottom of each corresponding post type's menu. You can see it by hovering over the menu item, or when the item is open. The current post is shown in **bold**, draft/pending posts are in *italics*, and child pages are listed under the parent.

<br />
For each post type, you can limit the number of items to display: for example, the five most recent posts.

You can also choose to order the post list by:

* *date* - order by date
* *title* - order by title
* *menu* - order by page order - "Used most often for Pages (Order field in the Edit Page Attributes box) and for Attachments (the integer fields in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery dialog), but could be used for any post type with distinct 'menu_order' values"

And the direction of the order:

* *ASC* - ascending - alphabetical (1, 2, 3; a, b, c)
* *DESC* - descending - new to old (3, 2, 1; c, b, a)

By default, they are set to display from most recent to older posts.
